# Decentralized Identity Verification System (DIVS)

## Project Overview

DIVS is a cutting-edge blockchain-powered identity management platform designed to revolutionize digital identity verification through secure, privacy-centric, and user-controlled mechanisms.

### Core Mission
Empower individuals with complete control over their digital identity while providing robust verification mechanisms for organizations and service providers.

## Key Features

### 1. Self-Sovereign Identity Management
- Blockchain-based identity creation independent of centralized authorities
- User-controlled identity generation and maintenance
- Cryptographically secure personal identity wallets
- Decentralized identifier (DID) generation using advanced cryptographic protocols

### 2. Verifiable Credentials Ecosystem
- Standardized credential issuance and verification framework
- Support for multiple credential types:
    - Educational certifications
    - Professional qualifications
    - Government-issued identifications
    - Professional licenses
- Cryptographic proof mechanisms ensuring credential authenticity

### 3. Comprehensive KYC/AML Integration
- Seamless integration with existing Know Your Customer (KYC) processes
- Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance verification
- Modular architecture supporting multiple regulatory frameworks
- Real-time compliance checking without compromising user privacy

### 4. Privacy-Preserving Selective Disclosure
- Granular control over identity attribute sharing
- Zero-knowledge proof techniques for minimal information revelation
- User-defined sharing permissions
- Contextual consent management for different service interactions

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- Decentralized network ensuring high availability and tamper-resistance
- Consensus mechanisms preventing unauthorized identity modifications
- Multi-layer security protocols

### Identity Storage
- Distributed storage of encrypted identity fragments
- Redundant backup mechanisms
- Quantum-resistant encryption standards

### Verification Mechanisms
- Multi-factor authentication
- Biometric integration options
- Reputation scoring for identity trustworthiness
